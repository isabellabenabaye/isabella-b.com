title: "Who is being killed by local police in Los Angeles County?"
summary: "The [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/) recently released their [database](https://github.com/datadesk/los-angeles-police-killings-data) of people who died at the hands of police in L.A. County since 2000. After reading their [article](https://www.latimes.com/projects/los-angeles-police-killings-database/) about it, I wanted to learn a little more about the two communities affected the most, particularly the Black community."
