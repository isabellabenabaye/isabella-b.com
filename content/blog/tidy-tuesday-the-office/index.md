The data this week comes from the [`schrute` R package](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/index.html) for *The Office* transcripts and [data.world](https://data.world/anujjain7/the-office-imdb-ratings-dataset) for IMDb ratings of each episode. The featured article is [The Pudding‚Äôs](https://pudding.cool/) [‚ÄòThe Office‚Äô Dialogue in Five Charts](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/), which is ‚Äòa breakdown of how every character contributed to the show‚Äô.  
<br />

## Ratings

*There are 188 The Office episodes.*

The first visualization I made was of the episode ratings of the entire
series, grouped by season. The width of the violin plot indicates the
density of the episodes with that particular rating.

Labeled above are the
highest rated episodes per season, except in the cases of season 1 and
8, which have their lowest rated episodes labeled. Unsurprisingly, those
two seasons were the lowest rated overall of the whole series. ‚ÄúGoodbye,
Michael‚Äù and ‚ÄúFinale‚Äù are tied with the highest IMDb ratings of 9.7,
with another fan favorite ‚ÄúStress Relief‚Äù coming in second with a rating
of 9.6.  
<br />

## Writers

I also wanted to look into who wrote the episodes and see if there were
any particular writers who did the most episodes.  
{{% staticref "files/tidy-tuesday/The Office Writers.png" %}}![Source: `schrute`. Graph: Isabella
Benabaye.](https://github.com/isabellabenabaye/tidy-tuesday/blob/master/2020/12_theoffice/The%20Office%20Writers.png?raw=true){{% /staticref %}} 
Mindy Kaling wrote 20 episodes
(including ‚ÄúGoodbye, Michael‚Äù üíó), while BJ Novak wrote the second
most at 15. Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg are next with 14. There
were 10 episodes without writer data.    
<br />

**Other questions I wanted answered but didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt make
visualizations about:**

  - Highest rated episodes - who wrote them? Who was in them?
      - Mindy Kaling, Greg Daniels, and BJ Novak each wrote three of
        episodes with the highest IMDb ratings (\>= 9). If the episode
        ‚ÄúNiagara‚Äù about Pam & Jim‚Äôs wedding is to be considered as two
        episodes, Mindy and Greg (who wrote both) would each have
        writted four.
  - What is the average rating of each writer‚Äôs episodes?
      - Can be found in the table below:
