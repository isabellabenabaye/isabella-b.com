# Black Lives Matter. 
In celebration of Black lives: A visualization of 479 records of Black Americans breaking the color barrier. ‚ùùThe first achievements by African Americans in various fields historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change.‚ùû [^1] The data is from Wikipedia's page ‚ùù[List of African-American firsts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_firsts)‚ùû.

I'm not an expert on the deep history of the Black experience in America. I'm continuously learning however, and will share a *few* introductory resources (there are many, many more) to learn below.

## Understanding the Roots

*"In these videos, scholars and historians explore the Key Concepts of the Teaching Hard History framework by <u>discussing slavery‚Äôs impact on the lives of enslaved people</u> in what is now the United States and the nation‚Äôs development around the institution. They also explain how <u>enslaved people influenced the nation, its culture and its history</u>."* [<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.tolerance.org/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/american-slavery/key-concept-videos)

<br>

The first boom in Black American firsts was in the **1860s**. In 1865 the 13th Amendment was ratified, abolishing slavery, **except as punishment for a crime**. This loophole merely changed the form of slavery by criminalizing behavior and enabling the police to force freedmen who were arrested to work for the state. If you aren't familiar, a good entry point to this issue is the documentary [13th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_(film)) by director [Ava DuVernay](http://www.avaduvernay.com/about). It discusses its lasting effects on racial inequality, justice, and mass incarceration in America, going through the "suppression of African Americans by disenfranchisement, lynchings and Jim Crow; politicians declaring a war on drugs that weighs more heavily on minority communities and, by the late 20th century, mass incarceration of people of color in the United States."
