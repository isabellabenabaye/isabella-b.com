# Black Lives Matter. 
In celebration of Black lives: A visualization of 479 records of Black Americans breaking the color barrier. "The first achievements by African Americans in various fields historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change." [^1] The data is from Wikipedia's page "[List of African-American firsts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_firsts)".

I'm not an expert on the deep history of the Black experience in America. I'm continuously learning however, and will share a *few* introductory resources (there are many, many more) to learn below.

### Understanding the Roots

The first boom in Black American firsts was in the **1860s**. In 1865 the 13th Amendment was ratified, abolishing slavery, **except as punishment for a crime**. This loophole merely changed the form of slavery by criminalizing behavior and enabling the police to force freedmen who were arrested to work for the state. If you aren't familiar, a good entry point to this issue is the documentary [13th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_(film)) by director [Ava DuVernay](http://www.avaduvernay.com/about). It discusses its lasting effects on racial inequality, justice, and mass incarceration in America, going through the "suppression of African Americans by disenfranchisement, lynchings and Jim Crow; politicians declaring a war on drugs that weighs more heavily on minority communities and, by the late 20th century, mass incarceration of people of color in the United States."
