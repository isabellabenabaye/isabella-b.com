    "# Step-by-step: Scraping Community (2009)'s IMDb Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of tutorials out there that teach you how to scrape movie ratings from IMDb, but I haven't seen any about scraping TV series episode ratings. So for anyone wanting to do that, I've created this tutorial specifically for it. It's catered mostly to beginners to web scraping since the steps are broken down. If you want the code without the breakdown you can find it [here]().\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wonderful DataQuest tutorial by Alex Olteanu that explains in-depth how to scrape over 2000 movies from IMDb, and it was my reference as I learned how to scrape these episodes. You can find it [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since their tutorial already does a great job at explaining the basics of [identifying the URL structure](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/#identifyingtheurlstructure) and understanding the HTML structure of a single page, I've linked those parts and recommend you read them if you aren't already familiar because I won't be explaining them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *this* tutorial I will *not* be redundant in explaining what they already did; instead, I'll be doing many similar steps, but they will be specifically for taking episode ratings (same for any series) instead of movie ratings."
