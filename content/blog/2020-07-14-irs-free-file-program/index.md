Many of those who need the money the most are paying a fee for a service they could have gotten for free. If you make more than $69,000, there is also the option to use their [Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free).

This graphic was inspired by Hasan Minhaj's Patriot Act episode [**Why Doing Taxes Is So Hard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xQQkzWhMOc). I highly recommend you check it out for a great introduction to these issues presented in an entertaining way! He and his team also created the more appealing website, [**TurboTax Sucks Ass**](https://www.turbotaxsucksass.com), where you can also find the Free File links, as well as the [Tax Avoidance Hall of Fame](https://www.turbotaxsucksass.com/hof) that showcases major companies who paid no federal income taxes in 2018 (and even received a *refund* from the IRS). And if you haven't already, check out all of the other [Patriot Act episodes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarEovlrD9QY-fy-Z6apIDQ).
