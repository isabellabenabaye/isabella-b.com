abstract: Conventional data visualization techniques give little consideration for how human perception affects one's comprehension of statistical charts. Motivated to address this inadequacy, the present paper seeks to study the improvement in statistical communication when visualization techniques are integrated with the Gestalt principles from cognitive psychology. Students from a local high school are made to take a timed chart comprehension exam where their test scores represent their level of understanding--to be compared based on the type of chart used (‘conventional’ versus ‘Gestalt-modified’)--hypothesizing that the latter is more effective in delivering its intended message to the student. This study aims to provide an evidence-based analysis towards finding more effective and efficient data visualization techniques in an age of data overload.
